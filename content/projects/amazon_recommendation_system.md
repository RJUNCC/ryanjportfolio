## Description

In this project, I used Rank Based, user-to-user + item-to-item Collaborative filtering, and Collaborative filtering with Matrix Factorization to [recommend items on Amazon to customers](https://github.com/RJUNCC/Projects_Challenges/blob/main/Great_Learning_Projects/Amazon_Recommendation_Systems/Recommendation_Systems_Learner_Notebook_Full_Code.ipynb) based similarity between items and users.
